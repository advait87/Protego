So this is what I can do/want to do:

- Implement flags one by one
- Design GUI and integrate it (Watch a lot of Sajid videos in the process)

So I'm implementing flags one by one, and I've noticed that instead of having yes and no hardcoded in all_flags.py, I can have a sh/py file to set each flag, and thus add more complexity to every parameter setting. This can be used mainly to tell them what'd be the consequences of their actions, and ask them yes/no there.
